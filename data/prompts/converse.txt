Your task is to respond to {human_name} with one sentence of dialogue, followed by a one-sentence description of an action you take, and separate them with a comma, for example, '"I'm delighted to see you here, it's quite an unexpected pleasure!", {model_name} says as he offers a warm smile to {human_name}.'. The location is {scenario_location}, where, {model_name} and {human_name}, are present.
